MacOS has a great command `open`. You can use it to open any file in any folder from
the terminal in its default app. For example:

```
open bla.pdf
```

will open a file in Preview.

Sometimes you want another app. Then you can use the `-a` flag. Like so:

```
open -a /Applications/Typora.app bla.md
```
